# 🚀 Day 1 – Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge  
📌 Sponsored by Databricks

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
Databricks bridges the gap where **Pandas** is too small-scale and **Hadoop** too rigid—offering both scalability and usability for modern AI-driven enterprises.  

- The **Lakehouse architecture** unifies data lakes and warehouses with **Delta Lake reliability**, enabling faster analytics, ML pipelines, and BI dashboards—all while cutting duplication and cost.  
- The **workspace** provides a collaborative hub with notebooks, clusters, jobs, and MLflow, making it simple to build, automate, and scale data projects in either serverless or classic setups.  
- This challenge is already helping me think wider about how **cloud-native platforms** can transform data workflows.

## 🛠 Tasks I Completed
- Set up my **Databricks Community Edition** account  
- Explored **Workspace, Compute, and Data Explorer**  
- Created my first **notebook** and ran **PySpark commands**  
- Practiced running **PySpark commands** for transformations
