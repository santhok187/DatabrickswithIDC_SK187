  - **Popular products by category & brand**  
- Built a **Feature Visualization Dashboard** with multiple tabs:
  - **Sales features** → ratios, conversion rates, purchases  
  - **Product in view & cart** → pricing trends, views over time  
  - **Category distribution** → share of product categories, conversion %  
- Added **global filters** for category and time.  
- Scheduled **dashboard refresh** for continuous insights.
